to run this, run make while in the main directory, i.e. MonteCarloMini. this will compile all of the files in the src dir

and then run java -cp ./bin MonteCarloMini.MonteCarloMinimizationParallel [arguments] in order to run the parrallel version

or 

you could rn "autorun.py" which will automatically compile the java files and run an example batch
